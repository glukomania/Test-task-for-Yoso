# What is done:
- Table component, listing data from storage;
- Add new user component, where there's a simple form for creation a new user. Data are saved in localStorage;
- A modal showing user details (can be opened by clicking on any row of the table;
- Four simple tests;

# What I would do further:
- User data edition (update data, delete user. I've added those methods, but had no enough time to implement edition);
- Paging, sorting and so on;
- Form verification;
- More tests. I had some unsusial errors of jest, so I waisted time on this. Unit testing is not my strongest side, but I study;
- Nice styling. I had no time for that and decided to focus on functionality;

# Time spent: 4 hours.
I intentionally stopped doing anything outside time range. 
I spent some time at the beginning for setting up the project (Just got an error from typescript and had to handle dependencies) and at the end, again handling some jest dependencies. So pure coding was about 2.5 hours.
